At some point in history, mankind decided that Earth wasn't enough, so they went to space and colonized several new planets.
In this effort some voyages were a great success, other were a terribly failure...

Because of poorly calculated route, your mothership entered an asteroids ring, and crashed!
As a last minute resort, the commander of the ship order that every one suits up their's space suit in order to maximize
their chances of survival in outter space.
A few small space ships managed to escape from the final blast of the mothership.
You are the pilot of one of that ships. Your misson: Rescue as many astronauts as you can!
Are you ready for the task?
