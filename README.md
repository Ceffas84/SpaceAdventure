At some point in history, mankind decided that Earth wasn't enough, so they went to space and colonized several new planets.

Because of poorly calculated route, your mothership entered an asteroids ring, and crashed!

You are the pilot of one of that ships. Your misson: Rescue as many astronauts as you can!
Are you ready for the task?
